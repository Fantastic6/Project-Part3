# Test Instructions - Part 3

The interface is almost the same as Part 2. The following is from the previous part:

Note (For mac users): We have a ... (OFF) button. It will turn off "OUR" computer and set all registers to 0. Then you can turn it back on by clicking on it. It will go to ON. 

Note (For windows users): The button will say OFF. 

Three ways to use the interface:

## One Instruction At a Time

1. Put in the instruction in the console. Click S.I.T - Single Instruction Test. This will set PC to 1 and store the instruction into mem[1].
2. It will run the instruction and does NOT increment the PC. 
3. If that is IN instruction, you need to put the number in the console and hit enter. 

## Run instructions from the File

Put the name of the file in the prompt:

Click Load. It will load the instructions into memory and set PC to the position of the first instruction. 

Click either: 

1. Single Step Switch Button: Run one instruction at a time and increment the PC by 1. 
2. Run button: Run the whole program. 

## Program 2

To run program 2, prepare a text file with your six sentences. 

Put the name of the file in the prompt. 

Click Load. It will load the instructions into memory and set PC to the position of the first instruction. 

Click either: 

1. Single Step Switch Button: Run one instruction at a time and increment the PC by 1. 
2. Run button: Run the whole program.
